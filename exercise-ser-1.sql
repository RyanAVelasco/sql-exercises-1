1. Write a SQL statement to create a simple table 
countries including columns country_id,
country_name and region_id.

Solution:
CREATE TABLE countries( 
    COUNTRY_ID varchar(2),
    COUNTRY_NAME varchar(40),
    REGION_ID decimal(10,0)
);
*/

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS countries(
    country_id VARCHAR(2), 
    country_name VARCHAR(56), 
    region_id VARCHAR(8),
    PRIMARY KEY(country_id)

/*
2. Write a SQL statement to create a simple table 
countries including columns country_id,country_name 
and region_id which is already exists. 
Note: I don't know what this question is asking.. so..
I'll interpret it as if the table doesn't exist

Note: My solution will be the same as Q1.

Solution:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS countries ( 
    COUNTRY_ID varchar(2),
    COUNTRY_NAME varchar(40),
    REGION_ID decimal(10,0)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS countries(

);

/*
3. Write a SQL statement to create the structure of 
a table dup_countries similar to countries. 

Note: To be honest, I don't see a difference between
how you would go about solving Q3 & Q4 because you
end up with the same result. Maybe I'm missing
something but the only difference I've noticed
is the wording of the question.

/*
4. Write a SQL statement to create a duplicate copy 
of countries table including structure and data by 
name dup_countries. 

Note: To be honest, I don't see a difference between
how you would go about solving Q3 & Q4 because you
end up with the same result. Maybe I'm missing
something but the only difference I've noticed
is the wording of the question.

The InnoDB Engine have been used to create the 
tables.

"A foreign key constraint is not required merely 
to join two tables. For storage engines other 
than InnoDB, it is possible when defining a 
column to use a REFERENCES tbl_name(col_name) 
clause, which has no actual effect, and serves 
only as a memo or comment to you that the 
column which you are currently defining is 
intended to refer to a column in another table."
